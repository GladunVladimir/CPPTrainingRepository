# C++ training repository created to help you understand more of language features as long as features of computer working process

Here I'll post tasks for you. Their will be easy as a conception, but require some understanding of basics underneath each step you take

## Structure

* Now structure will be easy. You will see folders for each task where I place *README.md*. This file will contain task description and some tips for you.

* After we complete sertain number of tasks, they will become a structural blocks for more complicated system that we will create, so there will be addditional branch making all of that pieces one system.

## Requirements

1. You are aware of code style, which your mentor at university gave you. I expect you to use them here as well. That's important.

2. Commit messages as I said before must be in English.

3. Keep your code cleen and easy to read without trying to understand what variable `x` means.

4. If you use some non-obvious algorythms or find any of them over the Internet and use to complete the task, please write a comment with it's name or main idea.

5. This repository is for my edit only. I expect you to fork it and for each task make pull requests.

6. Task will be completed once I confirm merge of your pull request. Until than I will review it and leave some comments and tips how to make it better.

## Afterword

It's all that I can think of now. I will be updating this file and make new tasks, so keep an eye for here.

## P.S

 Any questions is appreciated. Any mistakes you found is a +1 in your karma, so don't be shy to say me that I'm wrong :)
